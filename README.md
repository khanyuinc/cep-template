# cep-template
This project is a baseline template for making CEP in a professional
development environment based on how I like to code.  At this time 
this code has only been tested to work with After Effects 2014 and 
2015 on OSX.  I'm fairly certain this project will work out of the
box for Windows but there's no installer.


# How to gest started
```
$ git clone https://github.com/khanyuinc/cep-template.git
$ cd cep-template
$ npm install
$ grunt
```
Restart After Effects

1. From the terminal run <code>grunt</code>.
1. Test the extension in your target product(s) (i.e. After Effects, etc.).
1. Repeat
