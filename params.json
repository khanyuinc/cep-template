{"name":"Cep-template","tagline":"My baseline template for making and distributing Adobe CEP extensions","body":"# What is this project?\r\nThis project is a baseline template for making Adobe CEP extensions \r\nbased on how I like to code and how I think they should be \r\norganized and written.   It also provides or does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the code anywhere on your machine and the grunt script\r\nwill automatically deploy it into the CEP extensions directory.\r\n1. The code has been architected in a way that you can manage\r\nDEBUG and RELEASE builds of your extension easily.  Debug builds\r\nare deployed in a way that makes for easy debugging.  Release builds\r\nreference files that are sensibly stitched, minified, etc.\r\n1. Packaging and signing of the code is happening automatically on\r\nevery grunt run for simplicity and ease of use.  I'll do this more \r\nsmartly later.\r\n1. A very minimal architecture that handles automatic theming \r\n(based on Adobe's CEP samples) and a few helper classes to ease\r\ninterop with JSX code.\r\n\r\nThe code in the repo has only been tested to work \r\nwith After Effects 2014 and 2015 on OSX.  I'm fairly certain \r\nthis project will work out of thebox for Windows but it has \r\nnever been tested and there's no automation around Windows\r\neither.  If anyone wants to take that on I'd be stoked!\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress and will become better and more \r\ncomplete over time.  Here's a quick list of things I'd like\r\nto see happen with it:\r\n\r\n1. Organize the code in a more modular fashion perhaps more like \r\na jquery or node js module.\r\n1. Automate the creation of a pkg installer to make distribution easier \r\nfor people working on small internal projects\r\n1. Combile all statically loaded <code>jsx</code> files into \r\na single <code>jsxbin</code> file.\r\n1. Version bump in a sensible way for automated deployment.\r\n1. Have a story around adding an existing certificate. \r\n1. Not produce a new self-signed cert on every run (not a big deal)\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to get started\r\n1. Grab the code\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/khanyuinc/cep-template.git\r\n$ cd cep-template\r\n$ npm install\r\n$ grunt\r\n```\r\n1. Restart After Effects (or Photoshop, etc.)\r\n1. Make something cool (see Development Workflow below for details).\r\n1. Make a release build\r\n```\r\n$ grunt release\r\n```\r\n1.  Make an installer and distribute it.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n1. The grunt file automatically creates a new self-signed certificate\r\nevery time you make a new build.  This is completely overkill but I\r\ndid it for the ease of use for now and will probably make it smarter later.\r\n\r\n# Development Workflow\r\n1. Edit the files in the <code>src</code> directory.\r\n1. From the terminal run <code>grunt</code>.\r\n1. Test the extension in your target product(s) (i.e. After Effects, etc.).\r\n1.
